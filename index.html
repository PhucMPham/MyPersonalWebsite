				<h2>Hello, my name is Phuc Pham</h2>
				<p>But I'd rather people calling me Phil because I'm tired of people ask me toshow them how to pronounce my first name.</p> 
				<p>I'm an I.T major and an international student at Seidenberg. I'm from Vietnam. I lived in NY for 5 years when I went to Saint Anthony's high school and now at Pace University for a BS in Information Technology. I am expected to graduate in May 2019. Fun fact about me: I am in love with sneakers. Buying and selling sneakers are my hobby and great ways for me to earn extra money while in college. My most favorite pair of shoes is the Levi's x Air Jordan 4 Retro. This pair is so memorable for me because this was the first time I've ever won a raffle for pair of limited shoes. These are made up of denim which is the signature of the Levi's brand. I mean look at them, they are so beautiful! </p>

				<h2>Why am I taking this class?</h2>
				<p>I have one goal that I hope to be able to achieve after this class is to make my own website for my shop/brand. I know there are tons of options out there to build an online shop or a stunning website without any coding knowledge. However, the feeling of not be able to fully customize to how I want is very frustrating. I don't want to rely on other people to help me customize my website. Other than that, web developer is not a bad career so I want to learn these essential skills in web developing.

				<h2>My experience in this stuff...</h2>
				<p>I have very little real world experience in web developing although I took classes in html and javascript before. I feel like I don't know enough skills to actually develop a good website. Right now I'm taking as many programming language classes as possible including Python, Java, and this class. I hope I can acquire more programming language to use in the future.</p>

				<h2>Speaking of the future, my plan for the future is to...</h2>
				<p>Find an I.T job in the US. I'm planning to apply for graduate programs next year. Looking for sponsorship by companies. Study in the US is awesome and I would love to work and live here for a while. As mention earlier, I also have an idea to open a start-up company. But that's too ambition for now, hopefully it will be feasible in the near future. </p>
